# sctld_jamboree
Scripts and data for speedy analysis of SCTLD transcriptomes from several Caribbean coral species.

These transcriptomes were obtained for species both with and without reference genomes and transcriptomes, so two different sequencing methodologies were employed. Separate directores for each approach (RNAseq/TagSeq) contain the associated sample metadata, analysis scripts and pipeline outputs.
