# sctld_jamboree_RNAseq
Scripts and data for speedy analysis of SCTLD transcriptomes of *Colpophyllia natans* and *Pseudodiploria clivosa*

The sequencing reads for this experiment were paired-end, 150-bp reads obtained from the Illumina NovaSeq instrument at the University of Miami Center for Genome Technology core facility.

There are many options for analyzing RNAseq data, but a good summary of general best practices and recommended workflows can be found in Conesa et al. 2016: https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-0881-8
